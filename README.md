# World-Happiness-Report
## Global Happiness based on measured factors

This is a study over the classic question, "What is it that Defines Happiness?" Is happiness something that can be measured?
If so what factors most contribute to happiness? This is exactly the question I would like to ask. In this Dataset there is a 
measure of happiness called Ladder. Ladder is is measured by several contributing factors, the result being nations
that are happier and nations that are not. This Data was pulled from Kaggle, and the whole dataset was used for overall analysis.
It was structured using SQLite while MatPlotLib and Seaborn were used for visualization.
